This is the park, where we'll test your emotion recognition skills. 
I'm going to ask you to find someone with a specific emotion. 
When you think you've found them, hold down the right trigger and point the laser at the person. 
After you select a person, you will be asked to explain why you chose them. 
Press the right trigger when you're ready to begin.
